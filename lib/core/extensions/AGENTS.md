# extensions — Dart Extensions

## Purpose
Dart extension methods that add convenience functionality to built-in types used throughout the application.

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Extensions should be focused and well-documented
- Import extensions where needed — they augment existing types
- Keep extensions small and single-purpose

### Common Patterns
- Extension methods on `BuildContext`, `String`, `DateTime`, etc.
- Named extensions (e.g., `extension StringX on String`)
