# l10n — Localization

## Purpose
Application localization files providing English and Japanese translations. Uses Flutter's built-in internationalization system with ARB files as source and auto-generated Dart classes.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app_localizations.dart` | Auto-generated base class with all string keys |
| `app_localizations_en.dart` | English translations (~100+ strings) |
| `app_localizations_ja.dart` | Japanese translations (~100+ strings) |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- **Never manually edit** these files — they are auto-generated by `flutter gen-l10n`
- To add/modify strings: edit ARB files in `lib/l10n/` (`.arb` files), then run `flutter gen-l10n`
- Both `en` and `ja` ARB files must stay in sync (same keys)
- Usage in code: `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.stringKey`

### Testing Requirements
- Verify both locales have all keys after changes
- Test UI with both English and Japanese to check text overflow

### Common Patterns
- String interpolation via ARB placeholders: `"hello": "Hello {name}"`
- Pluralization supported via ARB plural syntax
- Default locale: English (`en`)

## Dependencies

### External
- `flutter_localizations` — Flutter i18n support
- `intl` — Internationalization utilities
